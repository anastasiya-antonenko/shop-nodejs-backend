# All tasks were completed:
Evaluation criteria :
* Product Service Serverless config contains configuration for 2 lambda functions, API is not working at all, but YAML configuration is correct
* The getProductsList OR getProductsById lambda function returns a correct response (POINT1)
* The getProductsById AND getProductsList lambda functions return a correct response code (POINT2)
* Your own Frontend application is integrated with Product Service (/products API) and products from Product Service are represented on Frontend. AND POINT1 and POINT2 are done.
Additional (optional) tasks
* +5 - Async/await is used in lambda functions
* +5 - ES6 modules are used for Product Service implementation
* +4 - Custom Webpack/ESBuild/etc is manually configured for Product Service. Not applicable for preconfigured/built-in bundlers that come with templates, plugins, etc.
* +4 - SWAGGER documentation is created for Product Service
* +4 - Lambda handlers are covered by basic UNIT tests (NO infrastructure logic is needed to be covered)
* +4 - Lambda handlers (getProductsList, getProductsById) code is written not in 1 single module (file) and separated in codebase.
* +4 - Main error scenarios are handled by API ("Product not found" error).
